                <h2>ABDUL MAJEED</h2>
                <p class="para2">I am currently a third-year student in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) specializing in AI and Machine Learning. My passion lies in the fields of data science and AI, and I have a strong inclination towards web development projects. With a solid understanding of Python programming language and a familiarity with C, I possess the necessary skills to work on projects involving data analysis, machine learning algorithms, and web development. I am excited to continue exploring and expanding my knowledge in these cutting-edge technologies to contribute to the ever-evolving world of AI and ML.<br>
                Furthermore, my journey in CSE has equipped me with a strong understanding of computer systems, algorithms, and data structures, which form the backbone of AI and ML applications. I have actively engaged in coursework and practical projects related to these domains, deepening my understanding of topics such as neural networks, data mining, and natural language processing.<br>
                 <span class="span"></span> In summary, as a third-year CSE student with a passion for data science, AI, web development, and a strong foundation in Python and C, I am eager to continue my learning journey and contribute to the ever-evolving fields of AI, ML, and data-driven applications.
